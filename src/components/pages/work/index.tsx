            I work as a full time Senior Designer at bOnline Ltd, a UK based
            company. dealing with small to medium sized business websites. In my
            spare time I enjoy watching Rugby, Football, American Football, hanging
            out with friends and playing PlayStation. The saying less is more is a key
            inï¬‚uence in my design and I utilise a very simplistic,
            minimalist style that effectively portrays my clients needs and expectations.
